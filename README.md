HR Employee Attrition
What is Attrition?
Attrition, in Human Resource terminology, refers to the phenomenon of the employees leaving the company. Attrition in a company is usually measured with a metric called attrition rate, which simply measures the no of employees moving out of the company (voluntary resigning or laid off by the company).

Importance of Attrition
High attrition is a cause of concern for a company as it presents a cost to the company. The company loses on the amount it spent to recruit and select these employees and to train them for their respective jobs.
The company may also have to spend additional money to fill the vacancies left open by these employees. Hence it becomes critical for a company to keep a tab on the attrition rate which down-sizes the employee base.
Types of Attrition
Broadly, there are two types of attrition which occur in any company.

Voluntary- When an employee leaves the company for a better job opportunity or career growth or more pay, and leaves on his own.
Involuntary- If an employee is terminated from a job due to some ethical issue or lack or performance. Sometimes, a degrowing business also forces employees to quit the job, which leads to a higher rate of people leaving.
Retirement- Once an employee finishes his/her tenure at a company and retires. This is mostly a natural attrition that occurs and companies are prepared with succession planning.
Knowing the most likely reasons why employees leave the organization, can help the organization take action and reduce the level of Attrition inside the organization.

Problem Statement:
Human Resources are critical resources of any organization. Organizations spend huge amount of time and money to hire and nurture their employees. It is a huge loss for companies if employees leave, especially the key resources.
Reasons for attrition can be plenty and range from dissatisfaction due to low salaries, less or no career growth opportunities, inferior employee supervision, eagerness to get into companies with global presence, lack of recognition, lack of freedom of expression in the organization and underutilization of talents and skills of the individuals.
Thus in a situation when more and more employees are quitting the organization, the attrition rate is on a rise. So if HR can predict weather employees are at risk for leaving the company, it will allow them to identify the attrition risks and help understand and provide necessary support to retain those employees or do preventive hiring to minimize the impact to the organization.
